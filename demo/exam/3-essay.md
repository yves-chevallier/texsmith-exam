    *The impact of technology on modern education*

    In the realm of learning, technology has paved new ways,
    Transforming classrooms, enriching minds in countless ways.
    From virtual lessons to interactive screens,
    Knowledge flows freely, breaking old routines.

    Students now explore with a click or a tap,
    Accessing information, closing the knowledge gap.
    Online resources and digital tools,
    Empower learners, making education cool.

    Yet, amidst this tech-driven spree,
    The human touch remains key.
    Teachers guide, inspire, and care,
    Ensuring learning is more than just software.

    As we embrace this digital age,
    Let’s balance tech with wisdom’s sage.
    For in this blend, we truly see,
    The future of education’s harmony.
